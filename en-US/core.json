You could try to rep a bot.\n- Bal: It did not show the user's data when it was used by mentioning someone, instead it told you your balances with the name of the other user.\n- Game state: Sometimes a wrong prefix was shown in the state instead of the global one.\n- Prefix, language and color: Sometimes the bot responds to a custom prefix not established in the servers, instead of the default, as with the color and language values _ (although the latter never received a report that the same) ._ Moved a few things to fix it and we'll see if the bug was fixed.",
